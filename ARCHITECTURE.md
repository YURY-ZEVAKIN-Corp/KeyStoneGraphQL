# KeyStoneGraphQL Solution Architecture

## 1. Solution Structure

This solution uses a layered architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. The projects in the solution are:

- **KeyStoneGraphQL**: Main API project (entry point, controllers, configuration)
- **KeyStoneGraphQL.Application**: Application layer (business logic, use cases, service interfaces)
- **KeyStoneGraphQL.Domain**: Domain layer (entities, value objects, domain services, interfaces)
- **KeyStoneGraphQL.Infrastrature**: Infrastructure layer (data access, external services, repository implementations)
- **KeyStoneGraphQL.Migration**: Database migrations and schema management
- **KeyStoneGraphQL.Tests**: Unit and integration tests

## 2. Layered Responsibilities

- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, validation, and response formatting. Should not contain business logic.
- **Application Layer**: Contains business logic, use cases, and service contracts. Depends on Domain layer.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains core business entities, value objects, and domain logic. No dependencies on other layers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements data access, external APIs, and other technical details. Depends on Application and Domain layers.
- **Migration Layer**: Manages database schema changes using tools like EF Core Migrations.
- **Tests Layer**: Contains all automated tests for the solution.

## 3. Project References

- `KeyStoneGraphQL` references `KeyStoneGraphQL.Application`
- `KeyStoneGraphQL.Application` references `KeyStoneGraphQL.Domain`
- `KeyStoneGraphQL.Infrastrature` references `KeyStoneGraphQL.Application` and `KeyStoneGraphQL.Domain`
- `KeyStoneGraphQL.Migration` references `KeyStoneGraphQL.Infrastrature`
- `KeyStoneGraphQL.Tests` references all other projects as needed

## 4. Best Practices

- Keep each layer focused on its responsibility.
- Use Dependency Injection for service and repository implementations.
- Avoid circular dependencies.
- Write unit tests for business logic in Application and Domain layers.
- Use configuration files for environment-specific settings.
